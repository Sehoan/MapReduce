# MapReduce

[MapReduce](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/mapreduce.pdf) is a programming model and processing technique for distributed computing that processes and generates large datasets across parallel, distributed clusters. Originally developed by Google, it simplifies data processing on large clusters.

## How it Works

The model is split into two main phases:
- **Map**: Takes input data and converts it into key-value pairs
- **Reduce**: Combines the mapped data based on their keys to produce the final output

## Key Features

- Parallel Processing
- Fault Tolerance
- Scalability
- Simple Programming Model

## Common Use Cases

- Log Analysis
- Data Transformation
- Search Indexing
- Machine Learning
